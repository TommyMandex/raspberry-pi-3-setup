# Raspberry Pi 3 Setup
The steps I took get my Raspberry Pi 3 up and running.

## Upgrade Jessie
Run the following commands to [upgrade Jessie to Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-pixel/), which includes Chromium with hardware video support:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y rpi-chromium-mods
sudo apt-get install -y python-sense-emu python3-sense-emu
sudo apt-get install -y python-sense-emu-doc realvnc-vnc-viewer
```

## Change Password
Run the following command, then enter the current password and a new password twice to confirm:
```
passwd
```

## Setup SSH
Launch the Raspbery Config:
```
sudo raspi-config
```

Go to `9 Advanced Options` then `A4 SSH` and choose `<Enable>`.

Open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and add the following:
```
PermitRootLogin no
ClientAliveInterval 30
ClientAliveCountMax 5
```

Then restart the SSH service:
```
sudo service ssh restart
```

## Disable Automatic Desktop Login
Run the configuration command:
```
sudo raspi-config
```

Go to `3 Boot Options` then `B3 Desktop` and choose `<Ok>`.

## Setup Display
Ensure the display works nicely over HDMI:
````
sudo nano /etc/boot.txt
```

Add the following lines to the bottom of the file:
```
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=16
hdmi_ignore_cec_init=1
hdmi_ignore_cec=1
hdmi_drive=2
gpu_mem=128
```

In order to disable HDMI CEC you also need to drop a config file on the recovery partition:
```
sudo su
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
echo hdmi_ignore_cec_init=1 >> /mnt/config.txt
umount /mnt
exit
```

Now reboot the system:
```
sudo reboot
````

## Install Kodi
Update repositories and install Kodi packages:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kodi
```

Create a Kodi shortcut on the desktop that boots in standalone mode (avoids blackscreen on exit):
```
touch ~/Desktop/kodi-standalone.desktop
nano ~/Desktop/kodi-standalone.desktop
```

Add the following contents to the file:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=Kodi
GenericName=Media Center
Comment=Manage and view your media
Exec=kodi-standalone
Icon=kodi
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=AudioVideo;Video;Player;TV;
```

## Install FAT32, ExFAT and NTFS File System Support
Install the following packages:
```
sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils ntfs-3g
```

## Mount NAS
Ensure the CFIS packages are installed:
```
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
```

Create a credentials file for the username and password:
```
touch ~/.smbcredentials
nano ~/.smbcredentials
```

Add the following contents, replacing the username and password:
```
username=username
password=password
```

Change the permissions of the credentials file:
```
chmod 600 ~/.smbcredentials
```

Make a directory to mount the NAS to:
```
sudo mkdir /media/NAS
```

Test you can mount the NAS manually:
```
sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.0.x/NAS /media/NAS -o user=username
```

Any mounting problems can be found by checking the logs:
```
tail -f  /var/log/kern.log
```

You can find out your users UID and GID with these commands:
```
id -u username
id -g username
```

Alternatively you can just use your username and group instead.

Now update the `/etc/fstab` file to auto mount the NAS as **read-only**:
```
//192.168.0.x/NAS /media/NAS cifs credentials=/home/username/.smbcredentials,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,ro 0 0
```

Or for full **read and write** add this to the `/etc/fstab` instead:
```
//192.168.0.x/NAS /media/NAS cifs credentials=/home/username/.smbcredentials,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,rw 0 0
```

_Note: Update the lines above with your own NAS IP address, mount directory, username, UID and GID accordingly. For devices running older versions of Samba you may need to add `,vers=1.0` after `ro` or `rw` above._

Now run this to mount the NAS:
```
sudo mount -a
```

Create a handy symlink to the NAS on the desktop:
```
sudo ln -s /media/NAS ~/Desktop/NAS
```

## Mount USB Drive
Find the UUID of the USB drive:
```
sudo blkid
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
```

The output should look something like the following. Note the _UUID_ value:
```
/dev/sda1: LABEL="USB DRIVE" UUID="1234-5678" TYPE="exfat" PARTUUID="ffffffff-01"
```

Make a directory to mount the USB drive to:
```
sudo mkdir /media/USB-Drive
```

Test mounting the drive manually to make sure it works:
```
sudo mount -t exfat -o uid=pi,gid=pi UUID=1234-5678 /media/USB-Drive
```

Now add the following to the `/etc/fstab` to auto mount the USB drive:
```
UUID=1234-5678 /media/USB-Drive exfat defaults,nofail,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=000,fmask=111 0 0
```

_Note: Update the line above with your own UUID, mount directory, file system, UID and GID accordingly._

Now run this to mount the USB drive:
```
sudo mount -a
```

Create a handy symlink to the USB drive on the desktop:
```
sudo ln -s /media/USB-Drive ~/Desktop/USB-Drive
```

To repair an exFAT drive on Windows run the following command:
```
chkdsk.exe /F Z:
```

_Note: Replace Z: with the relevant drive letter._

## Create EXT4 Drive

You can format a partition as EXT4:
```
mkfs.ext4 /path/to/mount -L YourLabel
```

You can also change the drive label afterwards:
```
e2label /path/to/mount YourLabel
```

And you can easily mount it in the `/etc/fstab` as follows:
```
UUID=1234-5678 /media/USB-Drive ext4 defaults,auto 0 0
```

## Backup NAS to USB Drive
First, create a directory to store the backup logs in:
```
mkdir ~/Backups
```

Then create an rsync ignore file, this will exclude unneccesary Windows and macOS files from being backed up:
```
touch ~/Backups/rsync_excludes.txt
```

And add the following contents:
```
$RECYCLE.BIN
$Recycle.Bin
._*
.AppleDB
.AppleDesktop
.AppleDouble
.com.apple.timemachine.supported
.dbfseventsd
.DocumentRevisions-V100*
.DS_Store
.fseventsd
.PKInstallSandboxManager
.Spotlight*
.SymAV*
.symSchedScanLockxz
.TemporaryItems
.Trash*
.vol
.VolumeIcon.icns
Desktop DB
Desktop DF
hiberfil.sys
lost+found
Network Trash Folder
pagefile.sys
Recycled
RECYCLER
System Volume Information
Temporary Items
Thumbs.d
```

Do a dry run (the `-n` flag) to ensure the correct files are being backed up:
```
rsync -rtvun --exclude-from="$HOME/Backups/rsync_excludes.txt" /media/NAS/ /media/USB-Drive/
```

Next, create a script to handle the backups:
```
touch Backups/backup.sh
```

With the following contents:
```
#!/bin/bash

BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/Backups"
BACKUP_LOG="$BACKUP_DIR/nas_backups_`date +'%Y-%m-%d'`.txt"
BACKUP_EXCLUDES="$BACKUP_DIR/rsync_excludes.txt"
BACKUP_LOG_DAYS=7

/usr/bin/rsync -rtvu --log-file="$BACKUP_LOG" --exclude-from="$BACKUP_EXCLUDES" --delete-after /media/NAS/ /media/USB-Drive/
find $BACKUP_DIR/nas_backups_*.txt -mtime +$BACKUP_LOG_DAYS -exec rm {} \;
```

Once you're happy it works you can add it to your user's crontab:
```
crontab -e
```

Add the following contents to it to run it every night at 1am:
```
SHELL=/bin/bash

0 1 * * * $HOME/Backups/backup.sh
```

You can add the `--exclude` option to exclude a specific pattern of files or directories, and the `--delete-after` option to ensure files deleted from the target are also removed from the destination.

You can see the last backup log by viewing the file contents:
```
cat ~/Logs/nas_backups_YYYY-MM-DD.txt
```

You can see what environment variables are available in the cron environment by adding the following to your crontab (you'll need to add whatver `* * * * *` you want):
```
env >> $HOME/Backups/cron_env.txt
```

You can also ensure any macOS hidden "dotfiles" are deleted by adding the following command to the `backups.sh` script:

```
find /media/NAS -not -path "*ExcludeDirectory*" -iname ".*" -type f -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

## Setup Steam Controller
The following instructions should allow you to use the Steam Controller wirelessly.

Download and install the Steam Controller Python drivers:
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/ynsta/steamcontroller.git
cd steamcontroller
sudo pip install libusb1
sudo python3.4 setup.py install
```

Now create the file rules file:
```
sudo touch /lib/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules
sudo nano /lib/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller-perms.rules
```

Then add the following to it:
```
# This rule is needed for basic functionality of the controller in
# Steam and keyboard/mouse emulation
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666"

# This rule is necessary for gamepad emulation; make sure you
# replace 'pgriffais' with the username of the user that runs Steam
KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="group", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"
```

_Note: Replace `group` with the group of user (e.g. `pi`)._

Now reload udev:
```
sudo udevadm control --reload
```

Start the driver and your controller should work:
```
sc-desktop.py start
```

To start the driver automatically at the desktop create the file:
```
touch ~/.config/autostart/Steam-Controller.desktop
nano ~/.config/autostart/Steam-Controller.desktop
```

Add the following contents to the file:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Exec=sc-desktop.py start
```

You can also install an on-screen keyboard:
```
sudo apt-get install florence
```

And then create a shortcut to it on the desktop:
```
touch ~/Desktop/keyboard.desktop
```

Then add the following contents to the file:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Keyboard
Exec=florence
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=florence
```

## Install Docker
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

## Install Pi Hole
```
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

## Install Useful Packages
```
sudo apt-get install tree screen tmux
```

## Notes
You can see the icons available for desktop shortcuts in `/usr/share/pixmaps/`
